## Student Performance Predictor using Machine Learning

![Project Screenshot](/images/image_1.png)





The Student Performance Predictor is a demonstration website built to showcase the potential of using machine learning to predict student math scores based on various demographic and educational factors. Utilizing Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, this project serves as a foundational exploration into how data science can be applied in educational settings.

## Overview

This demo website is designed as a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of predicting academic success in mathematics. While it currently focuses on math scores, the methodologies applied here could be extended to other subjects, offering a scalable model for educational predictions.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for demonstration purposes and as a starting point for more in-depth research. It utilizes a limited dataset, and while it provides valuable insights, it should not be used as a definitive reference for educational decisions without further data and research.

## Features

Predictive model focusing on math scores as a case study for academic performance prediction.
Analysis of how various factors, such as study time and parental education level, impact math scores.
An interactive website interface allowing users to input data and receive predictive scores.

Technologies Used

Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and model building.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Flask: For creating the web application interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Visual Studio and Jupyter notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

<git clone https://github.com/birukzlab/Mlprojects.git>


Navigate to the project directory:

<cd Mlprojects>

Install the required packages:

<pip install -r requirements.txt>


Run the Flask application:

<python3 app.py>

## Usage

After launching the web application, input the student details into the provided form on the web interface. The predictor will process the information and display the predicted performance in mathematics.
